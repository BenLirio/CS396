Demonstrate that mac() and verify() are correct by providing the MAC tag (in hexadecimal)
of the specified default message using the specified default key.

Explain which algorithm you implemented and why, and what are the domain-extension features of 
of your algorithm in relation to its security.
Since I needed to employ a MAC that authenticate messages of any size in a bandwidth-efficient manner, I implemented the algorithm for constructing a CBC-MAC. My implementation can take as input a message of any size by padding it to until it is a multiple of the block size. Also, my implementation of CBC-MAC only creates a tag that is the size of the block making it bandwidth-efficient. 
The domain-extension feature of my algorithm in relation to its security is it can securely handle messages of fixed size, messages of any siize, and messages of any fixed size.
