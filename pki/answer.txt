1)

If Mallory gives Alice Bob's old public key instead of the new public key,
and then Mallory gives Cindy Bob's new public key, then Cindy can perform a
man in the middle attack as follows.

When Alice sends a message to Bob, she encrypts it with Bob's old public key.
Cindy then intercepts this message, decrypts it, and re-encrypts it with Bob's
new public key. Cindy then forwards this message to Bob, who uses his new private
key to decrypt the message.

No one will become suspicious because Alice has no way of knowing that she should
use Bob's new public key because Mallory has not told her. Bob does not suspect anything
because he recieves messages encrypted using his new public key, as expected.


2)

One countermeasure is to add a time-stamp on the certificate C. When a user wants to send
a message, before using the public key supplied by Mallory, the user should check to see
if the certificate was signed within the last 24 hours. If it was not, the user can assume
that Mallory can not be trusted.

This means no more than 24 hours after Bob changes his public key, Cindy can not long perform
a man in the middle attack because the old public key is not longer valid.
